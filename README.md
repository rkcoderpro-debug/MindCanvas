# MindCanvas V3.8.0

MindCanvas is a visual study workspace for turning notes and private documents into editable canvases, mind maps and flashcards. V3.8 adds one server-side AI file pipeline for pasted text, clipboard screenshots, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, Markdown/CSV/JSON and common image files, with editable previews before Apply. It also adds a collapsible desktop navigation rail and a cleaner mobile-friendly source picker. V3.7.1 media/resize work and the V3.5.1 shared Gemini reliability hotfix remain included. This repository contains a React/Vite frontend, an Express server boundary for private AI/document operations, shared graph types, and Supabase migration scaffolding.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on Vite's default port and the API runs on `http://localhost:8787`. Without Supabase credentials, the app intentionally uses a blank local canvas. With Supabase configured, projects, folders, notes and source documents are scoped to the signed-in user through RLS. `.doc`/`.ppt` legacy files are intentionally rejected; export them as `.docx`/`.pptx` first.

See [PROJECT_HANDOFF.md](./PROJECT_HANDOFF.md) for architecture, setup, credentials, current limits, and the next implementation slices.

Để cấu hình Supabase, Google OAuth và deploy hai service lên Render, làm theo [DEPLOY_V1_VI.md](./DEPLOY_V1_VI.md).
